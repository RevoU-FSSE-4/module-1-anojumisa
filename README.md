## Overview

### The Assignment

This is the first assignment of the Full Stack Software Engineering Program at [RevoU](https://revou.co/), Section Amsterdam, Module 1. In this assignment, students are required to create a foundational HTML structure with the following components:

-   Page Structure and Semantics: Implement the basic structure of a web page and ensure the use of correct semantics for each HTML element.

-   Content: Add relevant content to the website.

-   Form Set: Create a form set that includes input types such as text, text area, submit button, as well as buttons, checkboxes, and a select dropdown.

-   Create readme.md in Repository: Add a readme.md file to the repository to provide information about the assignment or project.

By completing these tasks, students will demonstrate their understanding of HTML fundamentals and their ability to create structured and semantically correct web pages with various form elements.

### My Topic of Choice

For this assignment, I am creating a website for the Indonesian developer community called <strong>JEKI</strong>, which stands for <strong>Jejaring Kode Indonesia</strong>, freely translated into English as the Indonesian Code Network. This project aims to serve as a hub for software engineers, developers, and tech enthusiasts to gather and discuss everything related to coding within the country.

Indonesia, being a nation where the majority speaks Indonesian, faces a barrier when it comes to accessing technology updates, as most documentation is available only in English. This language barrier can impede Indonesian tech enthusiasts from progressing and competing with developers who are native English speakers. Therefore, this project serves as a platform for Indonesian developers to comfortably share, discuss, and interact using the language they are proficient in.

It's important to note that while English remains the most widely used language globally, this project acts as a bridge to help Indonesians quickly adapt to technological advancements and level the playing field. By providing a space where they can communicate in their native language, Indonesian developers can accelerate their learning and participation in the global tech community, ultimately preventing them from being left behind.
