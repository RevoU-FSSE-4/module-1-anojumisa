## Overview

### The Assignment

This is the first assignment of the Full Stack Software Engineering Program at [RevoU](https://revou.co/), Section Amsterdam, Module 1. In this assignment, students are required to build a webpage using semantics for each HTML element.

Students are also required to apply responsive design with media queries, flexbox, and a sticky navigation header, and deploy the final webpage to Netlify or GitHub pages.

### My Topic of Choice

For this assignment, I am creating a website for the Indonesian developer community called <strong>JEKI</strong>, which stands for <strong>Jejaring Kode Indonesia</strong>, freely translated into English as the Indonesian Code Network. This project aims to serve as a hub for software engineers, developers, and tech enthusiasts to gather and discuss everything related to coding within the country.

Indonesia, being a nation where the majority speaks Indonesian, faces a barrier when it comes to accessing technology updates, as most documentation is available only in English. This language barrier can impede Indonesian tech enthusiasts from progressing and competing with developers who are native English speakers. Therefore, this project serves as a platform for Indonesian developers to comfortably share, discuss, and interact using the language they are proficient in.

It's important to note that while English remains the most widely used language globally, this project acts as a bridge to help Indonesians quickly adapt to technological advancements and level the playing field. By providing a space where they can communicate in their native language, Indonesian developers can accelerate their learning and participation in the global tech community, ultimately preventing them from being left behind.

### Highlights

Highlights of My Project:

1. Responsive Navigation Bar: The navigation bar seamlessly adapts to different screen sizes, incorporating a convenient hamburger menu for screens smaller than 600px.
2. Dynamic Text Animation: I implemented a subtle yet engaging text animation with CSS for the "JEKI Jejaring Kode Indonesia" section, enhancing its visual appeal.
3. Structured Layout with Grid & Flexbox: Leveraging grid and flexbox models, I effectively arranged and aligned content within each section, ensuring a responsive and visually balanced layout.
4. Interactive Hover Effects: I added various hover interactions to different sections like the navbar, footer, and social media buttons, creating a more engaging user experience.
